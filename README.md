# machine_learning_project-unsupervised-learning

## Project Outcomes
- Unsupervised Learning: perform unsupervised learning techniques on a wholesale data dataset. The project involves four main parts: exploratory data analysis and pre-processing, KMeans clustering, hierarchical clustering, and PCA.
### Process:
### Step 1 :: Import CSV file and explore data:
 Import CSV file in Notebook and explore data using EDA analysis.
### Step 2 ::  Data Preprocessing:
 After preprocessing the data, an exploratory data analysis was conducted to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset. This involved performing descriptive statistics, visualizing data distributions, and identifying patterns and trends within the crime data. EDA techniques such as histogram, scatter plot, and bar chart were utilized to explore relationships between variables and identify potential insights.
### Step 3:: Apply Unsupervised Techniques:
  It is a machine-learning algorithm.  It involves exploring the data and identifying similarities, differences, and relationships among the data points without any predefined categories or labels.
 
## Results
  In this project, I built various EDA for data exploration and understanding of datasets. Thus, I found the distributorâ€™s annual spending between 10k to 20k on every product not more than that.
  Dataset is not normally distributed and scaled thus, I did normalize and scale data, so our machine learning model work properly and we get proper output.
  In k mean clustering use the elbow rule and I found a number of clusters 8 also I created a data point and centroid with various clusters. And also, to minimize the sum of distances between the points and their respective cluster centroid.
  In Hierarchical clustering, I get the numbers in parenthesis are numbers of observations.
  In PCA, I implemented dimensionality reduction to 4 components because on 4 components I get 90% of explained variability. 

## Future Goals
If i have more time i want to more explore data and create more machine learning model and find which one is good.
